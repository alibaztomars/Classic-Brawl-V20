## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](https://www.mediafire.com/download/lad3x7a0745gkpq)
- Just replace the IP and Port in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libsb9838.config.so and /lib/x86/libsb9838.config.so```)
